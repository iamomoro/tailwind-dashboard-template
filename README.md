#Tailwind dashboard template

This is a responsive dashboard template built on top of TailwindCSS and fully coded in React. It comes with several pre-coded charts (built with Chart.js 3) and widgets, and it's a great starting for anyone who wants to create a user interface for SaaS products, administrator dashboards, modern web apps, and more.
